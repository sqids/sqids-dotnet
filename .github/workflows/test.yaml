          dotnet-version: 7.0.x # NOTE: The `windows-latest` container already comes pre-installed with the .NET versions that we need, but we do need to use `setup-dotnet` (and pass it one of the versions — e.g. 7.0.x), so that the relevant binaries (e.g. `dotnet`) are actually added to PATH so we can use them. See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#preinstalled-software and https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet

      # TODO: Some .NET codebases with GitHub Actions workflows seem to run `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` as separate steps. Why?
